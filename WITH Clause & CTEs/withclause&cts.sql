WITH HighEarners AS (
    SELECT emp_id, emp_name, salary
    FROM employees
    WHERE salary > 60000
)
SELECT * FROM HighEarners;

-- ðŸ”¹ CTE used with Aggregation
WITH DepartmentSalary AS (
    SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department_id
)
SELECT * FROM DepartmentSalary
WHERE avg_salary > 60000;

WITH DeptAvg AS (
    SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department_id
),
AboveAvgEmps AS (
    SELECT e.emp_id, e.emp_name, e.salary, d.avg_salary
    FROM employees e
    JOIN DeptAvg d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
    WHERE e.salary > d.avg_salary

WITH RECURSIVE fib(n, value) AS (
    SELECT 1, 0
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 2, 1
    UNION ALL
    SELECT n + 1, (SELECT value FROM fib WHERE n = fib.n - 1) + (SELECT value FROM fib WHERE n = fib.n - 2)
